# General Suggestions

## State Initialization
- **Issue**: Initializing `selectedProduct` in `OrderForm` with the first product's ID directly might lead to issues if the `products` array is empty.
- **Solution**: A safer approach would be to handle this initialization after the products have been fetched, possibly using a `useEffect` hook.

## Input Validation
- **Issue**: There's a need for validation for the quantity input to avoid negative numbers or non-integer values if your application requires it.
- **Solution**: Implement input validation to ensure data integrity.

## Error Handling
- **Issue**: Current error handling in `handleSendOrder` uses `console.error` or `alert`, which might not be the most user-friendly approach.
- **Solution**: Enhance error handling to provide user-friendly feedback, perhaps using a modal or toast notification.

# Comments and Code Extraction

## Frontend (`OrderForm.jsx` and `OrderCreate.jsx`)

### Extract Complex Logic
- **Issue**: The order details construction logic is embedded within `handleSendOrder`.
- **Solution**: Consider extracting this logic into a utility function for cleaner code and potential reuse.

### Comment on Component State
- **Action**: Add comments above state declarations explaining what each state is for to improve code readability.

### Comment on Event Handlers
- **Action**: Describe what actions are performed by each event handler, especially `handleSubmit` and `handleSendOrder`, for clarity.

## Utility Functions

### Basket Operations
- **Issue**: If `addToBasket` and `removeFromBasket` functions grow more complex, they might clutter component files.
- **Solution**: Consider moving them to a separate utilities file for organization and reuse.

### Date Handling
- **Issue**: Date handling might become more complex with further development.
- **Solution**: Consider creating a date utility file for operations like formatting or calculations, keeping date-related logic centralized and reusable.
